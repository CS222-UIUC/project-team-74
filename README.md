# HandyHelper
HandyHelper is a web-based platform that connects requesters with handymen, allowing users to post service requests, browse handyman profiles, and directly contact them. Requesters can create job listings with descriptions, prices, and locations, while handymen can search for jobs by specialty and location. Handymen can update their profiles with additional details and specialties, while both parties can manage personal details and upload profile pictures. The platform specifically targets students, offering affordable labor through peer-to-peer connections.
